# Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data. 
# As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines biology, computer science, information engineering, mathematics and statistics to analyze and interpret biological data.
# This course represents an introduction to the field and provides a survey of computational tools and analysis applied to biological questions.
# Some Helpful Skills for Course Success:
Curiosity and interest in exploring “hidden” patterns from high throughput genome sequence data 
Ability to work independently on computational exercises when directed tasks and protocol
Problem solving and troubleshooting during exercises
Curation of scientific literature and extraction of datasets from published manuscripts
